## Hypothoses
### There is a correlation between food deserts and crime rates.  We would expect to see higher crime rates in food deserts
### There are current studies that show correlation between feed deserts and poverty
### The team is determining whether deserts correlated wo other variables such as crime
  
## Definitions
### Food Desert:  An urban area in which it is difficult to buy afordable or good-quality fresh food
### NPU:  Neighborhood Planning Unit as defined by the City of Atlanta.  It incorporates multiple neighborhoods into groups.
### Grocery Store:  The classification was chosen as opposed to convenience stores or fast food restaturants because of the emphasis on healthy food by the former.
 
## Data Sources 
#### Grocery Store Data:  Yelp API
#### Crime Data:  City of Atlanta crimes that occurred during 2021 regardless of when reported, downloaded from the Atlanta Police Department.
#### NPU Data:  City of Atlanta ArcGIS

###  Count of Each Data Set per NPU

### Number of crime incidents by NPU

### Number of Grocery Stores by NPU

### Top Three NPUs for Crime

### Comparison of Crime and Grocery Locations

### Generated Crime Heat Map Using GMAPS

### Trend Line of Correlation 
 
## Conclusions
### There is correlation between the locations of grocery stores and crimes.
### Correlation shows that generally that generally speaking where there are more grocery stores, there is more crime not the opposite as we assumed.
### We note that correlation does not necessarily imply with casutation.
### The figures were not adjusted for population, which could impact the outcome of out analysis.
### It would be interwesting to see whether subsets of crime would provide graeter impact to the analysis.
